Title: Efficient Analysis of STDF Files for Yield Improvement Using a Desktop Application
Introduction: In semiconductor manufacturing, test log data in the Standard Test Data Format (STDF) contain millions of test entries, unlike EDS/FT bin or yield data stored in spreadsheets or relational databases. STDF files are binary files specifically designed for Automated Test Equipment (ATE) data storage. Every day, semiconductor wafer and integrated circuit testing generates thousands of STDF files, which are essential for Samsung product engineers in debugging test programs, analyzing parametric yield loss, targeting inline ET issues, and resolving margin problems to improve overall yield.
Despite its widespread adoption, STDF has limitations, particularly in metadata capture, restricting the scope of analysis. Converting STDF files into more accessible formats is necessary but challenging. Open-source libraries in Python, R, and C++ exist, but they require expertise to use effectively. Another challenge is file size: converted spreadsheets typically range from 10 to 100 gigabytes. Transferring these files using the company-provided secure file transfer (S2) and processing them in the cloud is nearly impossible.
Proposed Solution: Our solution simplifies and enhances STDF file analysis through a desktop application that processes data locally, avoiding cloud transfer constraints. The application enables real-time upload, viewing, and graphing of parsed STDF files, providing key insights for rapid adjustments to parametric or functional failures, ultimately improving yield.
Methodology: The STDF Analyzer is a Python-based GUI tool designed for efficient STDF analysis, integrating commonly used methods and graphical representations for streamlined test program comparisons. Figure 2 illustrates the average MSR analysis and file processing time: for 20 sample STDF files (including baseline and issue wafers), processing takes nearly 280 minutes per analysis request, with most time spent on spreadsheet data cleaning and file concatenation.
To reduce processing time, we developed an algorithm that automatically detects whether a test item represents a parametric or functional failure. Based on extracted specification limits, units, and data formats, the STDF Analyzer categorizes data into Parametric and Functional Failures. The analyzer then concatenates cleaned files, joining data based on test item names. If a test item appears in multiple files, data is merged; if new test items are detected, new columns are created and appended accordingly. Figure 3 details the STDF file joining rules: test items meeting user-defined criteria automatically extract specification limits and convert data before final integration. Non-numeric issue data, such as fuse information or final functional test results, is excluded from the final dataset to maintain consistency.
Beyond data processing, the STDF Analyzer provides a comprehensive solution for data analysis and visualization. Traditionally, engineers must load each cleaned spreadsheet into tools like Spotfire or JMP for further analysis. In contrast, the STDF Analyzer integrates multiple visualization methods, allowing engineers to quickly identify problematic test items and highlight failure bins. The application can automatically generate test item composite maps and cumulative density function (CDF) plots with corresponding specification limits.
Additionally, the STDF Analyzer offers a one-click solution for generating Cpk calculations and yield tables, assisting engineers in identifying margin issues and reviewing highlighted bins. This streamlined approach significantly reduces the time and effort required for analysis while improving accuracy and efficiency in yield improvement efforts.
Figure 4 presents the architecture of the new processing flow for MSR analysis. Instead of tra Multiple STDF files are converted into spreadsheet data, and users select file paths within the STDF Analyzer. The program then processes and concatenates multiple files automatically. Finally, an internal algorithm parses the test data into a structured sequence format using Pandas DataFrame for efficient handling and analysis.
Results and Discussion: The STDF Analyzer provides a more efficient and streamlined solution for handling and processing complex STDF data, significantly enhancing the MSR analysis workflow for SAS PE engineers. As illustrated in Figure 6, the use of the STDF Analyzer drastically reduces analysis time, decreasing from the original 280 minutes per request to just 30 minutes. This improvement allows engineers to focus more on identifying issues and improving yield rather than spending excessive time on data processing and cleaning.
The increased efficiency in MSR analysis has also led to a significant rise in the number of MSR requests handled within the PE department, as shown in Figure 7. Since February 2024, engineers have been able to manage a greater variety of MSR analysis requests from different departments, improving overall productivity. The ratio of submitted to completed jobs has increased by over 30% since the implementation of the STDF Analyzer.
Moreover, the STDF Analyzer has generated substantial cost savings for the PE department. Previously, MSR analysis relied heavily on Galaxy Pro, a commercial software requiring an investment of over $30,000 for three licenses. The implementation of the STDF Analyzer has significantly reduced this expense while providing an in-house, highly efficient, and scalable alternative. This transition has not only lowered operational costs but also enhanced the overall efficiency and effectiveness of STDF data analysis within the organization.
